My name is Zheng-wei Wang (王正蔚). I obtained my Ph.D. advised by [Prof. Tomas E. Ward](https://www.computing.dcu.ie/~tward/) and [Dr. Graham Healy](https://www.computing.dcu.ie/~ghealy/). My Ph.D. is carried out in the area of neuroscience and deep learning. We proposed a Neuroscore derived from human's EEG signals to effectively evalute the performance for Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Here is my [Ph.D. Thesis](http://doras.dcu.ie/23729/).  

I am currently a Research Fellow working with [Prof. Aljosa Smolic](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=HZRejX4AAAAJ&hl=en). My current research interest focuses on video understanding especially for video action recognition.
