    My name is Zheng-wei Wang (王正蔚). 
    I obtained my Ph.D. at Insight Centre for Data Analytics, Dublin City University,
    where I was advised by <a href="https://www.computing.dcu.ie/~tward/">Prof. Tomas E. Ward</a> 
    and <a href="https://www.computing.dcu.ie/~ghealy/">Dr. Graham Healy</a>. 
    My Ph.D. is carried out in the area of neuroscience and deep learning.
    We proposed a Neuroscore derived from human's EEG signals to effectively evaluate the performance for Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
    Here is my <a href="http://doras.dcu.ie/23729/">Ph.D. Thesis</a>.

    I am currently a Research Fellow working with <a href="https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=HZRejX4AAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Aljosa Smolic</a>.
    My current research interest focuses on video understanding especially for video action recognition.
